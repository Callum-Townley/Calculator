I decided to make a calculator before i start on larger projects because i wanted to improve my Javascript knowledge specifically (I only started learning it not too long ago).

Features:
*Can do a wide variety of mathematical operations, including logs, trig functions, powers and roots
*Has a shift button which changes both the colour and functionallity of certain buttons
*Can swap between degrees and radians

If I were to continue this project, I would probably add more buttons and improve the visual look of the calculator.
